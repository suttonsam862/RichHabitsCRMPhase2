# Phase 4 STOR-1: Storage Security Implementation Summary

## Overview
Complete implementation of authorization-guarded signed URL issuance for file storage operations, ensuring secure file access with proper organization-based access controls.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Storage Library (`server/lib/unified-storage.ts`)

#### File Validation
- **File Type Validation**: Strict allow-list of file types (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, SVG, PDF)
- **Size Limits**: 10MB maximum file size enforced at multiple layers
- **Filename Sanitization**: Path traversal protection and safe character filtering
- **Content Type Validation**: Ensures file extension matches declared MIME type

#### Security Functions Added
```typescript
validateFileType(filename, contentType) // File type and extension validation
createAssetUploadUrl(orgId, filename, contentType, folder) // Secure upload URL generation
createBatchAssetUploadUrls() // Batch upload with validation
getAssetDownloadUrl(storageKey, expiresIn, orgId) // Time-limited signed URLs
deleteAsset(storageKey, orgId) // Organization-validated deletion
```

#### Organization Boundary Enforcement
- All storage operations validate organization ownership
- Storage keys follow pattern: `org/{orgId}/{folder}/{filename}`
- Organization validation prevents cross-org file access

### 2. Secure API Endpoints (`server/routes/organizations/assets.ts`)

#### Authorization-Protected Endpoints
- **POST** `/organizations/:id/assets/upload` - Single file signed URL generation
- **POST** `/organizations/:id/assets/batch-upload` - Multiple file signed URL generation  
- **GET** `/organizations/:id/assets/:folder/:filename` - Secure file serving via signed URLs
- **GET** `/organizations/:id/assets` - Asset listing with folder filtering
- **DELETE** `/organizations/:id/assets/:folder/:filename` - Secure file deletion
- **DELETE** `/organizations/:id/assets` - Batch file deletion

#### Security Features
- **Organization Role Validation**: Uses `requireOrgAdmin()` and `requireOrgReadonly()` middleware
- **Time-Limited URLs**: All signed URLs expire within 1 hour
- **Secure Headers**: Content-Type-Options, CSP headers on all responses
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for all request validation

### 3. Enhanced File Routes

#### Branding Files (`server/routes/files/branding.ts`)
- **Security**: Organization admin access required for uploads/deletes
- **Validation**: File type, size, and path validation
- **Boundary Checks**: All operations validate organization ownership
- **Audit Trail**: Security event logging for all operations

#### Portfolio Files (`server/routes/files/portfolio.ts`)
- **Access Control**: Authenticated users can upload, admins can view/delete
- **User Isolation**: Files stored per email address with proper separation
- **Validation**: File type and size validation
- **Admin Features**: Portfolio review and management capabilities

### 4. Security Middleware Integration

#### Organization Security (`server/middleware/orgSecurity.ts`)
- **Role-Based Access**: Owner > Admin > Member > Readonly hierarchy
- **Database Validation**: Real-time membership verification via RLS policies
- **Super Admin Bypass**: Configurable super admin access
- **Security Logging**: All access attempts logged with context

#### Authentication (`server/middleware/auth.ts`)
- **Token Validation**: Supabase JWT verification
- **User Context**: Complete user profile loading from database
- **Security Events**: Failed auth attempts logged
- **Error Handling**: Secure failure modes with minimal information disclosure

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Input Validation
- **Zod Schemas**: Type-safe request validation
- **File Type Checking**: Extension and MIME type validation
- **Size Limits**: Enforced at multiple layers
- **Path Sanitization**: Prevents directory traversal attacks

### 2. Access Control
- **Organization Boundaries**: All file operations respect org membership
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Admin required for uploads/deletes, readonly for downloads
- **User Isolation**: Portfolio files isolated per user email
- **Super Admin Controls**: Configurable elevated access

### 3. Secure File Serving
- **Signed URLs**: Time-limited access tokens (1 hour expiry)
- **Private Cache**: Cache-Control headers prevent public caching
- **Security Headers**: XSS and content-type protection
- **Audit Logging**: All file access logged

### 4. Data Protection
- **Organization Isolation**: Files cannot be accessed across organizations
- **Storage Key Validation**: Prevents unauthorized path access
- **Batch Operation Security**: Validates all files in batch operations
- **Error Handling**: Minimal information disclosure on errors

## API Security Examples

### Secure Upload Flow
```typescript
// 1. User requests upload URL
POST /api/v1/organizations/{orgId}/assets/upload
Authorization: Bearer {jwt}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "filename": "logo.png",
  "contentType": "image/png",
  "size": 1024000,
  "folder": "branding"
}

// 2. System validates:
// - User is authenticated
// - User has admin role in organization
// - File type is allowed
// - File size is within limits
// - Organization exists and user has access

// 3. Returns signed URL
{
  "success": true,
  "uploadUrl": "https://supabase.../storage/v1/object/upload/sign/...",
  "publicUrl": "https://supabase.../storage/v1/object/public/app/org/{orgId}/branding/logo.png",
  "storageKey": "org/{orgId}/branding/logo.png",
  "folder": "branding"
}
```

### Secure Download Flow
```typescript
// 1. User requests file access
GET /api/v1/organizations/{orgId}/assets/branding/logo.png
Authorization: Bearer {jwt}

// 2. System validates:
// - User is authenticated
// - User has readonly access to organization
// - File exists and belongs to organization
// - Folder is allowed

// 3. Redirects to time-limited signed URL
HTTP 302 Redirect
Location: https://supabase.../storage/v1/object/sign/app/org/{orgId}/branding/logo.png?token=...
Cache-Control: private, max-age=300
```

## Testing and Verification

### Security Test Cases
1. **Cross-Organization Access**: Verify users cannot access files from other organizations
2. **Role Enforcement**: Confirm admin-only operations reject non-admin users
3. **File Type Validation**: Test rejection of unauthorized file types
4. **Size Limits**: Verify large file uploads are rejected
5. **Path Traversal**: Confirm directory traversal attempts are blocked
6. **Token Expiry**: Verify signed URLs expire correctly
7. **Authentication**: Test unauthenticated access is properly denied

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Security Event Logging**: All access attempts logged with context
- **Error Tracking**: Failed operations logged with sanitized error details
- **Performance Monitoring**: File operation metrics and timing
- **Audit Trail**: Complete trail of file operations for compliance

## Compliance and Standards

### Security Standards Met
- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against injection, broken access control, security misconfiguration
- **Data Protection**: Organization isolation and user privacy
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions for each operation
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of validation and access control

### Audit Features
- **Request Logging**: All file operations logged with user context
- **Security Events**: Failed access attempts and suspicious activity
- **Error Tracking**: Sanitized error logging for debugging
- **Compliance Reporting**: Audit trail suitable for compliance requirements

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables Required
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Admin access key for storage operations
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Public access key for user operations

### Database Requirements
- Organization membership tables with proper RLS policies
- User authentication and role management
- Audit logging table for security events

### Storage Configuration
- Supabase Storage bucket: `app`
- Public read access for signed URLs
- File size limits: 10MB
