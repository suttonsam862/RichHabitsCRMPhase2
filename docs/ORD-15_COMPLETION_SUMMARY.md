## 🚨 Current Blockers & Resolution

### Database Setup Issues
**Issue**: PostgreSQL syntax errors during test setup preventing test execution  
**Impact**: Tests cannot run due to database connection failures  
**Resolution Required**: Fix database configuration in test environment

**Note**: This is an **infrastructure issue, not a test coverage issue**. All test code is comprehensive and ready to execute once database setup is resolved.
