# 🗂️ Contribution Guidelines

## Branching
- main = production-ready
- feature/* and fix/* for work

## Commits
- Conventional commits (feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor)
- Reference issue/CR when relevant

## Quality Gates
- `npm run lint` and `npm run build` pass
- `npm run test` (or `test:unit`) pass
- `npm run db:validate` passes

## PRs
- Include rationale, screenshots (if UI), and note if schema/API changed
- Update docs when user-facing/API behavior changes
