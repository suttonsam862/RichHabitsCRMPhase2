We are cleaning up the split-brain front-end architecture discovered in the audit (duplicate ./src and ./client/src React apps, 29 export collisions, alias drift).

Goal
- Make client/src the single canonical React app tree.
- Quarantine the legacy ./src frontend safely, without deleting code.
- Align Vite + tsconfig aliases so imports resolve consistently.
- Ensure build/dev runs only from client/.

Scope
- Front-end only. Server untouched in this prompt.

Steps
1) Migration Plan
- Create docs/FRONTEND-CANONICALIZATION.md.
- List files in ./src not in client/src but still referenced.
- List files in client/src that supersede ./src.
- Add a “Post-migration checklist” with checkboxes.

2) Guardrails
- Add client/src/guard/no-cross-root.ts exporting CANONICAL_ROOT="client/src".
- Add ESLint rule banning imports from top-level ./src into client/src.

3) Path Aliases
- In client/tsconfig.json, set baseUrl = "./src".
- Add paths: { "@/*": ["src/*"] }.
- In client/vite.config.ts, set resolve.alias { "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "src") }.

4) Entry & Router
- Ensure only client/index.html, client/src/main.tsx, client/src/App.tsx exist as entrypoints.
- If duplicate index.html/main.tsx exist in ./src, move them to client/_legacy/src-[timestamp]/.

5) File Sync
- Copy into client/src any missing files from ./src that are still referenced in routes or imports.
- Keep client/src versions when conflicts exist.
- Move legacy ./src files into client/_legacy/src-[timestamp]/ for reference.

6) Verification
- Update Vite build/dev config so it serves exclusively from client/.
- Run a grep for imports reaching into top-level ./src from client/ and fail build if any remain.
- Confirm “npm run dev” launches client (5173) only.

Deliverables
- docs/FRONTEND-CANONICALIZATION.md with migration notes and checklist.
- client/_legacy/src-[timestamp]/ containing old frontend.
- Updated tsconfig.json and vite.config.ts.
- ESLint rule to ban cross-root imports.
- Confirm working dev build from client/.

Constraints
- Do not delete files — only move to _legacy.
- Do not modify server code in this prompt.
