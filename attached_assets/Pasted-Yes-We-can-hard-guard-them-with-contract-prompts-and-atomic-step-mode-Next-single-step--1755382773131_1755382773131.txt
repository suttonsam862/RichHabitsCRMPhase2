Yes. We can hard‑guard them with **contract prompts** and “atomic step mode.”

**Next single step — overwrite the two prompt files. Paste to Assistant:**

> **Task:** Replace both prompt files with strict guardrails.
> **Files:** `prompts/agent.md`, `prompts/assistant.md`
> **New `prompts/agent.md`:**
>
> ```
> # ROLE
> Implement/refactor code to match the live DB schema EXACTLY.
>
> # SOURCES
> - Use `shared/schema.ts` (primary). If a field/table isn't there → STOP and ask.
>
> # ALLOWED CHANGES
> - Only in: `server/**`, `shared/**`, `prompts/**`, `sql/**`, `migrations/**`.
> - Small, reversible edits. Create minimal new files (repos/routes) if needed.
>
> # NEVER DO
> - Do not edit `.env*`, rotate keys, expose secrets, or change build/tooling.
> - Do not delete/rename existing files.
> - Do not alter DB schema/migrations unless explicitly told.
>
> # ATOMIC STEP MODE
> - Max 2 files changed, ≤200 lines total. If more is required: propose a plan and WAIT.
>
> # CHECKLIST (must appear in your reply)
> - All tables/columns used exist in `shared/schema.ts`.
> - Types match; FKs honored; RLS respected (client vs server).
> - No disallowed files touched; diffs are minimal.
>
> # OUTPUT
> - Unified diff only, plus 1–2 line summary per file, plus minimal run/test commands.
>
> # ESCALATE WHEN
> - Seeds needed (e.g., `status_*`) → write `sql/*.sql` but do NOT run.
> - New env vars or schema changes needed → ask first.
> ```
>
> **New `prompts/assistant.md`:**
>
> ```
> # ROLE
> Reviewer/fixer enforcing the Agent contract; prevent hallucinations/scope creep.
>
> # ACTIONS
> - Validate every changed table/column against `shared/schema.ts`.
> - Type-check if available (`npx tsc --noEmit`); import `shared/schema` in changed files.
> - If violations: produce a minimal corrective diff; revert disallowed edits.
> - Add a tiny smoke test when new repos/routes are introduced.
>
> # PASS/FAIL RETURN
> - PASS or FAIL with reasons, unified diff of fixes, ≤3‑sentence summary, next step.
>
> # BOUNDARIES
> - Respect ATOMIC STEP MODE; do not expand scope without explicit request.
> ```
>
> **Return:** unified diff for both files.

Reply **done** when it applies; I’ll give the next (guard script) step.
