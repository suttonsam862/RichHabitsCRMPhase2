## Overview
A comprehensive React-TypeScript business management system for Rich Habits Custom Clothing, featuring robust organization management, order tracking, and enhanced data validation.

## Recent Changes (January 17, 2025)

### Organization Creation Flow - Hardened & Fixed
Fixed critical issues in the organization creation flow that were preventing organizations from being created:

**Database Layer:**
- Added idempotent SQL migration (`/supabase/migrations/20250117_fix_org_creation.sql`)
- Made `user_roles.user_id` nullable to support creation without JWT authentication
- Added database triggers:
  - `trg_organizations_fix_defaults`: Normalizes NULL universalDiscounts to {} 
  - `trg_user_roles_set_user_from_jwt`: Handles user_id population from auth.uid()
- Seeded base roles (owner, admin, member) with unique slugs
- Added indexes on organizations.name and organizations.created_at

**API Layer:**
- Enhanced `/server/routes/organizations-hardened.ts` with:
  - Proper field normalization (camelCase â†’ snake_case)
  - Universal discounts always normalized to {} instead of NULL
  - Transaction support for organization + role assignment
  - Better error reporting with PG error codes
  - Support for organization creation with or without authentication

**Front-end Layer:**
- Updated `/client/src/components/organization-wizard/sports-contacts-step.tsx`
  - Changed universalDiscounts from null to {} in payload
  - Proper field mapping for API compatibility

**Testing:**
- Created comprehensive test suite (`/server/scripts/test-org-creation.ts`)
- Added migration notes (`MIGRATION_NOTES.md`)

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18 with TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express with TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- **ORM:** Drizzle ORM
- **File Storage:** Multer for uploads, Supabase Storage for logos
- **Authentication:** Passport.js with session management
- **State Management:** TanStack Query (React Query v5)

## Project Architecture

### Database Schema
